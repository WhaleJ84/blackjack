# Blackjack

A janky terminal game of blackjack.
This is purely for my educational purposes and is not intended for anyone's enjoyment.
You have been warned.

## Usage

Within the root directory, run the following:

```shell
cd src/
python3 main.py
```

## Caveats

- Cannot change the value of an ace after it has been set
- Probably loads of bugs
- Code is messy
